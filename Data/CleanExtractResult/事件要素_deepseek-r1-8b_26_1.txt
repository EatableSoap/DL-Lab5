  "core_event": "中国人民银行发布《2024年第二季度中国货币政策执行报告》，并联合相关部门加强金融对乡村全面振兴的支持措施。"
}
But core event should be a separate sentence? No, only structured fields.
Better to stick to the extraction:
subject_action: Based on text, actions include:
- 加强金融支持（strengthen financial support）
- 增加信贷供给（increase credit supply）
- 推动数字赋能（promote digital empowerment）
But for JSON, need a single string or concise description.
Perhaps subject_action can be "加强金融对乡村振兴的支持" with details in additional fields.
I am considering setting:
- time: The most recent reference is the 2024 Q2 report, but not an event time. So "未提及".
- location: Since no specific event is tied to a location, and it's discussed at national level, I'll set to "国家级" for impact scope or keep as general.
The field is "location", which might imply the place where the action occurs, but here actions are not bound to a specific time. So perhaps "未提及".
Let's proceed with:
time: "未提及"
location: "未提及" (no specific event location)
industry: "农业"
subject: "中国人民银行、国家金融监督管理总局、农业农村部等部门"
object: "乡村全面振兴"
subject_action: "加强金融支持并实施具体措施，如发布政策报告和开展专项行动"
object_reaction: "未提及"
For sentiment, I'll assign a score of +3 based on the overall positive tone with some challenges addressed.
Now for arrays:
future_impacts: ["缩小城乡金融差距", "提升乡村金融服务水平"]
additional_details: ["2024年第二季度货币政策执行报告发布", "5月末涉农贷款余额60万亿元同比增长12.1%", etc.]
But need to list only key details from the text.
I think I have a good enough response.
